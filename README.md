### Sheet 1: Simple Division and Trace Precedents
- Demonstrates a basic division formula.
- Uses Excel's "Trace Precedents" tool to show the source cells for calculations.

### Sheet 2: Logical Operators (IF Formula)
- Applies the `IF` formula with logical operators to evaluate conditions and return specific results.

### Sheet 3: Statistical Functions (SUMIF, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS)
- Demonstrates how to use `SUMIF`, `SUMIFS`, and `COUNTIFS` for conditional summing and counting based on multiple criteria.

### Sheet 4: Lookup Functions (VLOOKUP and Error Handling)
- Implements `VLOOKUP` for searching and retrieving data from another table.
- Includes error handling to manage cases where the lookup value isn't found.

### Sheet 5 & 6: Sample Data for Lookup Functions
- Contains sample data to be used in conjunction with Sheet 4's lookup functions.

### Sheet 7: Data Validation and INDEX-MATCH
- Sets up data validation rules to restrict input values.
- Uses `INDEX` and `MATCH` functions for more flexible lookup capabilities.

### Sheet 8: COUNTA, OFFSET, and SUM Functions
- Demonstrates the use of `COUNTA` to count non-empty cells, `OFFSET` to create dynamic ranges, and `SUM` to total values.

### Sheet 9: Text Functions
- Uses `LEFT`, `MID`, `RIGHT`, `SEARCH`, `ISNUMBER`, and `LEN` functions to extract and manipulate text strings.

### Sheet 10: Date & Time Functions
- Showcases `TODAY`, `NOW`, and various date/time-related functions (`YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, etc.) for date calculations and time management.

### Sheet 11: Conditional Formatting
- Demonstrates how to apply conditional formatting to highlight cells based on specific conditions.
